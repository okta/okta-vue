/**
 * Reduces a flow-context `originalUri` to a router-navigable path.
 *
 * `resumeFlow()` resolves to `Record<string, any>` — the `meta` object recorded when the flow
 * started — so `originalUri` is untyped external input. Anything that isn't a string, or that points
 * off-origin (or doesn't parse), collapses to the fallback rather than being handed to the router
 * as-is.
 *
 * Lives in its own module rather than inside `LoginCallback.vue` so it can be unit-tested directly;
 * `<script setup>` blocks have no module-level scope to export helpers from.
