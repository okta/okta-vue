// Stand-in for `@okta/spa-platform`, wired up through `moduleNameMapper` in jest.config.js.
//
// The real package is ESM-only ("type": "module", no `require` condition in its exports map) and
// jest's `transformIgnorePatterns` leave node_modules untransformed, so importing it from a spec
// throws ERR_REQUIRE_ESM. Only these two bindings need to exist: they are the only *values*
// src/client-js/ imports from the package. Everything else it uses — `AuthorizationCodeFlowOrchestrator`,
// `SessionLogoutFlow`, `Token`, `TokenOrchestrator` — is imported as a type and erased at compile
// time, so the specs stub those as plain objects instead.

export class FetchClient {
  constructor (orchestrator) {
    this.orchestrator = orchestrator
  }

  fetch () {
    throw new Error('The FetchClient test stub does not fetch. Pass a `fetchClient` double instead.')
  }
}
